# moosTechBlog
Welcome to my Tech Blog!  This app serves as a proof of concept.  It was a means for me to learn how to handle login information in a secure manner, use cookies, and have users post and delete from a database.

I plan on posting the scripts to tech based videos here, feel free to make your own account on the heroku deployment and post to the blog.

### How To Run
After forking the repository, you want to make sure node is installed on your device.
1. Within the terminal for the repo you want to run an npm install.
```
npm install
```
2. You then want to set up your .env file with the correct credentials.
3. Open mysql and make the source schema.sql within the db folder.
4. Run an npm run seed command to seed the databases.
```
npm run seed

5. Start the server using the npm start command.
