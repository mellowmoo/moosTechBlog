      "description": "The M1 Macbook Air is arguably the best budget laptop on the market right now.  Powered by the M1 chip, this laptop had desktop performance, all the while boasting a 20 hour battery life.  This thing is INSANE."

      "description": "As a budding web developer, most of my studying has been done on my laptop.  Due to offices reopening, I have been traveling with my laptop all the time.  I was recently looking for professional looking laptop bags for use in the city and came across the Bellroy Tokyo Totepack.  This thing has a dedicated laptop pocket, with two interiour sleeves for a waterbottle and a small umbrella.  Bellroy makes their products out of a combination of ethically sourced plastics and high quality leather.  I have been using this backpack for about a month and its been absolutely wonderful."

      "title": "Cyberpunk 2077: The biggest disappointment of the Decade",
      "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 was arguably the most hyped videogame in history (next to half life 3).  On its release, it came out as a broken, unplayable mess.  In the aftermath, CD Projekt Red had to pay back millions in refund and their publicly traded stock lost around 60% of its value.  They are currently being sued by both people who bought the game and people who own their shares.  Overall, this is a disaster and should be taken as a lesson to budding developers.  If you plan to release a product that will be iterative and grow overtime, make sure your customers know and are okay with that.  Bussiness live by customer satisfaction and we cannot afford to abuse our clientelle."
